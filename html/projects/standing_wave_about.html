<body style="background-color: #F0F0F0; font-size: 1em; font-family: Arial;">
    <p>A standing wave, also known as a stationary wave, is a wave that remains in a constant position.
        The standing wave may arise as a result of interference between two waves traveling in opposite
        directions, for example the incident wave and the reflected wave, resulting when the incident
        wave "bounces" of the wall. Two opposing waves combine, add or subtract depending on their
        phase (sign) to form a standing wave.<br><br>
        In the demonstration you may:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>observe the incident wave, the reflected wave, and the resulting standing wave,
            individually or together by checking/unchecking the boxes</li>
        <li>stop the animation at any moment by pressing "Stop" button</li>
        <li>analyze the wave in a step-by-step fashion by pressing the "Step" button</li>
        <li>restart the animation by pressing "Animate"</li>
        <li>restart the simulation by pressing "Restart"</li>
        <li>observe higher energy harmonics (up to <em>n</em> = 5) by moving the slider</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The standing waves can persist only if their wavelength (λ) matches the length of the box (<em>L</em>),
        i.e., an integral number (<em>n</em>) of half-wavelengths must fit exactly, <em>n</em>λ/2 = <em>L</em>. where <em>n</em>  = 1, 2, 3, ...
        If this quantization condition is not obeyed, the wave disintegrates as is simulated when a noninteger <em>n</em> is chosen
        (after "Snap to harmonics" checkbox in unchecked).<br><br>
        The higher the value of <em>n</em> the number of nodes (points where the wave amplitude is zero)
        increases and so does the wave frequency and its energy.
