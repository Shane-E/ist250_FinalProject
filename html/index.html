            <p>
                My name is Shane Eckenrode and I’m a current senior majoring in Systems Design & Development at Penn State’s college of IST.
                I have developed this online portfolio website to exemplify my skills and projects which I have contributed to and completed.
            </p>
            <p>
                I’ve always been interested in learning about software development and web design,
                but I also have interests in application development and video game design.
                I’ve interned for Penn State’s Chemistry Department in which I developed
                2 JavaScript applications for a class eBook. I have experience in several programming languages
                including HTML, CSS + Bootstrap, JavaScript + jQuery, PHP, Java, and ActionScript to name a few.
            </p>
            <p>
                For the future, I will be looking to begin my career as a web, application or software developer
                for an innovative company.
